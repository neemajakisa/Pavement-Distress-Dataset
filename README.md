# Pavement-Distress-Dataset
The dataset comprises top-down images from Kansas City, Missouri acquired using Laser Crack Measurement Systems (LCMS). 
This distinctive dataset includes polygon-based annotations that combine both the type and severity of cracks. 
It can be utilized for training and benchmarking unified Pavement Condition Index (PCI) estimation models.
